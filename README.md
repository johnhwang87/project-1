Hello, world! I have created a game called SquashEmz, using my newly acquired skills in javascript, jQuery, css, and html. 

The point of the game is to squash as many bugs as you can, while avoiding squashing the butterflies. You have 60 seconds to accomplish this task, and your score will be presented to you once the timer counts down to zero. You can click the shift button to 'clean' the keyboard (yay for immersion!... sort of).
I have tried incorporating all the things I have learned in the past few weeks of my bootcamp at General Assembly, and learned so much at the same time. The key part of my code (and the hardest part for me...) was to match the location of the moving bugs to where the keys lie on screen. Once this part was done, the other parts fell in place. 
I had many plans for this game, and what I wanted to do with it, but alas, my skills are not at the level where I want them to be. 

I will definitely be coming back to this project in the future, and incporating some of my other ideas I had when thinking of this game. One thing I wanted to add was different bugs that would switch keys on the keyboard, set difficulty levels where more bugs spawn smaller and smaller, as the keyboard disappears, and even a two player mode.
